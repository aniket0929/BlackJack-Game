# BlackJack-Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic casino card game Blackjack (also known as 21), developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Game Overview:
Blackjack is a popular card game where the player's objective is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total sum of 21. Each player is dealt two cards initially and can request additional cards (hit) to increase their hand value or choose to stand, meaning they are satisfied with their current hand value.

Features:
User-friendly Interface: The game provides a clean and intuitive interface designed using HTML and CSS, making it easy to understand and play.
Scoring System: The game calculates and displays the total sum of the player's hand, as well as the dealer's hand, allowing players to make informed decisions.
Win/Lose Conditions: The game accurately determines win, lose, or draw conditions based on the player's and dealer's hand values.
Responsive Design: The game interface adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

Getting Started:
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Gameplay:
Click the "Start Game" button to start the game and receive initial cards.
Click "New Card" to draw an additional card if you want to increase your
hand value.

Winning/Losing:

If your hand value is 21 then you win.
If your hand value exceeds 21 you lose.

Restart:
You can restart the game at any time by clicking the "start game" button again.
